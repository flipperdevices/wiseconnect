## Purpose/Scope

- This application contains an example code to demonstrate the microphone functionality

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs SiWx917 Development Kit [BRD2605A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-dk2605a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-dev-kit?tab=overview)

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio
- Serial console Setup
  - For Serial Console setup instructions, refer to [link name](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#console-input-and-output).

### Setup Diagram

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#install-the-wiseconnect-3-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#connect-siwx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#update-siwx91x-connectivity-firmware)
- [Create a Studio project](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#create-a-project)

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- Configure the following parameters in [`mic_example.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_mic/mic_example.c) file, update/modify following macro if required.

  ```C
    #define MIC_N_CHANNELS         2  // Number of Mic channels
  ```   

  Note: `MIC_N_CHANNELS` selects mono (1) or stereo (2).
  - 1 (mono): Captures a single microphone channel. This reduces CPU load and memory/buffer usage; the console reports one dBSPL value.
  - 2 (stereo): Captures two microphone channels. Overall sample throughput and buffer consumption increase; the console reports dBSPL per channel when supported. Ensure both mic channels are available/wired on your board.

  ```C
    #define MIC_SAMPLE_BUFFER_SIZE 512 // Mic buffer size to collect mic samples    
  ```  

## Test the Application

1. Compile and run the application.
2. Verify that the application successfully outputs the dBSPL (decibel) values in the console logs as shown below.
