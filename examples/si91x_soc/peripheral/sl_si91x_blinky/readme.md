## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#install-the-wiseconnect-3-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#connect-siwx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#update-siwx91x-connectivity-firmware)
- [Create a Studio project](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#create-a-project)

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

Configure the following parameter in [`blinky.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_blinky/blinky.c) file. Update or modify following macro if required.

  ```C
    #define TOGGLE_DELAY_MS 500//  configured for 500 ms   
  ```

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

1. Compile and run the application.
2. Sets the board state of LED0 to ON and OFF for configured blink rate.
3. LED0 should blink on WSTK/WPK base board.

  > **Note:**
  >
  > LED0 will continuously be turned on and off.
> **Note:**
>
> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
