## Purpose/Scope

- This application demonstrates the use of the SysRTC module to generate periodic events.

## Overview

- The SYSRTC (System Real Time Clock) is a highly configurable RTC capable of serving multiple cores. It contains up to 2 groups, where the number of compare- and capture-channels within each group is parameterized individually. Each group has it's own interrupt- and configuration-registers. The main idea is to save power by letting all groups share a single counter.
- Counter - The counter is shared between all groups. It can be started/stopped by writing to START/STOP fields in CMD register. RUNNING field in STATUS register indicates if counter is running or not. By default, counter will halt when core is halted during debug. RUNNING is not affected by halting. If DEBUGRUN in CFG register is set, counter will not halt when core is halted. The count value can be accessed via CNT register even when it is not running. When CNT is written, count value will be updated on the next clock edge. When the counter reaches the maximum value of 0xFFFFFFFF, it will overflow to 0x00000000 on the next clock edge. All OVFIF interrupt flags are set when this happens.
- Compare Channel - When count value matches CMPnVALUE, and CMPnEN in CTRL register is set, the CMPnIF interrupt flag is set. At the same time, PRS output is updated according to CMPnCMOA value in CTRL register. CTRL and CMPnVALUE can be written at any time and will take effect immediately.
- Capture Channel- When CAPnEN in CTRL register is set, the count value will be captured into CAPnVALUE based on PRS input edges. CAPnEDGE in CTRL register controls which edges that will result in capture. When count value is captured, CAPnIF interrupt flag is set.A capture event is generated whenever RUNNING status set, the corresponding GRP_CTRL_CAPEN register setting set and the desired PRS input edge occurs according to the GRP_CTRL_CAPEDGE register setting. This event is followed by GRP_IF_CAPIF being set after up to 3 cycles. At the same time when the corresponding flag is set the GRP_CAPVALUE register captures the current counter value. Note that PRS input edges should not occur more frequently than once in 3 cycles. If counter is being started/stopped or GRP_CTRL_CAPEN/GRP_CTRL_CAPEDGE being reprogrammed close to the PRS input edge, please account for the race condition.

### What is PRS?  
- In the context of SYSRTC, PRS(Peripheral Reflex System ) is used to connect compare events to GPIO pins as PRS_OUT or to feed external signals into the SYSRTC as PRS_IN for capture event .

- [`sysrtc_example.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_sysrtc/sysrtc_example.c) this example file demonstrates how to use sysrtc

### For PRS_IN / PRS_OUT GPIO Configuration
If you are configuring PRS_IN or PRS_OUT through GPIOs:
- 	GPIOs must be selected from the UC (Universal Configurator).
- 	For compare channels, the corresponding GPIO pin which is selected as PRS_OUT will be toggled when the compare match occurs.
- 	For capture channels, use ulp_gpio_10 (or other mapped GPIO) and connect it to the corresponding GPIO pin which is selected as PRS_IN.
- 	To enable GPIO-based PRS configuration, define the macro in `SYSRTC_PRS` in [sysrtc_example.c](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_sysrtc/sysrtc_example.c)

> **Note:**
>
>- When Compare channels are enabled : Toggles LED for ten times every second and timer stops
>- When Capture channel is enabled : Toggles LED one time after one second

> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
