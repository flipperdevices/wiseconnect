## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure the Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (USART) in synchronous mode as a master. It sends a block of data to a synchronous slave and simultaneously receives the slave's response for loopback verification.

## Overview

- USART is used in communication through wired medium in Synchronous fashion. It enables the device to communicate using serial protocols.
- This application is configured with following configs:
  - Tx and Rx enabled
  - 8 Bit data transfer
  - Synchronous Master
  - Stop bits 1
  - No Parity
  - No Auto Flow control
  - Baud Rates - 115200

## About Example Code

- [`usart_sync_example.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_usart_sync_master/usart_sync_example.c) – Demonstrates configuring the USART to send and receive data in synchronous master mode.
- In this example, first USART gets initialized if it was not already initialized with the clock and DMA configurations if DMA is enabled using [`sl_si91x_usart_init`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/usart#sl-si91x-usart-init). 

- If the UART/USART instance is already selected for debug output logs, initialization returns `SL_STATUS_NOT_AVAILABLE` (this is informational; the application continues using the existing instance).
- After initialization, USART configured (clock, pins, synchronous mode, etc.) using [`sl_si91x_usart_set_configuration()`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/usart#sl-si91x-usart-set-configuration) either from UC parameters or from user-defined macros.
- Then the register user event callback for send and receive complete notification is set using [`sl_si91x_usart_multiple_instance_register_event_callback()`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/usart#sl-si91x-usart-multiple-instance-register-event-callback).
- After setting the user event callback, the data send and receive can happen through [`sl_si91x_usart_transfer_data()`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/usart#sl-si91x-usart-transfer-data).
- When the transfer completes, the transmit and receive buffers are compared to confirm loopback success.

### Configuration Macros

The header file [`usart_sync_example.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_usart_sync_master/usart_sync_example.h) exposes build-time macros:

| Macro | Purpose | Effect if Disabled | Error Returned? |
|-------|---------|--------------------|-----------------|
| `SL_USART_SYNCH_MODE` | Ensures the example validates synchronous mode operation. | Example runs but will not explicitly assert synchronous usage; configuration may fall back to default UC settings. | No – operation continues. |
| `USE_SEND` | (Reserved for continuous send sequencing) Intended to enable repeated transmit cycles. | Currently unused in code; disabling has no effect. | No. |
| `USE_RECEIVE` | (Reserved for continuous receive sequencing) Intended to enable repeated capture cycles. | Currently unused in code; disabling has no effect. | No. |
| `NON_UC_DEFAULT_CONFIG` in [`usart_sync_example.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_usart_sync_master/usart_sync_example.c) | Use hard-coded default configuration instead of UC component settings. | UC (Universal Configuration) values are used. | No – configuration API returns standard status. |

These macros do not cause failures when disabled; they gate optional or illustrative behavior. If you require custom pin/baud/synchronous settings without UC, enable `NON_UC_DEFAULT_CONFIG` and adjust the structure values in `usart_sync_example.c`.

For low‑level peripheral routing and pin assignments you can also edit the device configuration header `RTE_Device_917.h` (advanced usage – normally UC handles this automatically).

## Application Build Environment

### Configuration of USART at UC (Universal Configuration)

- Configure UC from the slcp component.
- Open the **sl_si91x_usart_sync_master.slcp** project file, select the **Software Component** tab, and search for **USART** in the search bar.
- You can use the configuration wizard to configure different parameters. The following configuration screen illustrates what the user can select as per their requirements.

  > ![Figure: Selecting UC](resources/uc_screen/usart_uc.png)
- Connect master (this example) and a board flashed with the slave example: master clock pin (GPIO_8 or GPIO_25 depending on board) to slave clock pin, master TX (GPIO_30) to slave RX, master RX (GPIO_29) to slave TX.
- The Application has been configured to run in Synchronous Master mode.

### Pin Configuration of the AC1 Module Explorer Kit

  | USART PINS              | GPIO    | Explorer kit Breakout pin  |
  | ----------------------- | ------- | ------------- |
  | USART_MASTER_CLOCK_PIN  | GPIO_25 |     [SCK]     |

  | USART_MASTER_RX_PIN     | GPIO_29 |     [AN]      |

### Flow Control Configuration

To enable hardware flow control (RTS/CTS):

1. Open `sl_si91x_usart_sync_master.slcp` → Software Components → USART.
2. Set the **Flow control** field to **RTS/CTS**.
3. Assign RTS and CTS pins either:

- Through the UC pin assignment widget (preferred), OR
- Manually by editing [`RTE_Device_917.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/components/device/silabs/si91x/mcu/core/chip/config/RTE_Device_917.h) and locating the USART0 RTS/CTS section.

4. Use the following default mapping if your Pin Tool is unavailable:

  | Signal | GPIO  | WPK Breakout | AC1 Explorer |
  |--------|-------|--------------|--------------|
  | CTS    | GPIO_26 | P27 | [MISO] |
  | RTS    | GPIO_28 | P31 | [CS]   |

- If the Pin Tool is not working, UC changes plus manual verification in `RTE_Device_917.h` ensure proper hardware flow control routing.

## Test the Application

1. Flash `sl_si91x_usart_sync_master` on one board and `sl_si91x_usart_sync_slave` on a second board (or use the slave project example).
2. Wire clock, TX, and RX between the two boards as listed in the pin tables.
3. Open a serial console for each board.
4. Reset both boards; the master initiates a 1024‑byte full‑duplex transfer.
5. After transfer completion the application compares `usart_data_out` and `usart_data_in` and prints the loopback result.
6. Expected console output (master):

## Configuring higher clock

- To achieve baud rates exceeding 2 million bps, need to modify the clock source to INTF PLL CLK or SoC PLL CLK in the UC. 

> **Note**:
>
> - To monitor incoming data during debugging sessions, add the `usart_data_in` buffer to your watch window. This allows you to inspect received data in real time while stepping through the code.
> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
> - By default, Request to Send (RTS) and Clear to Send (CTS) flow control signals are disabled in the UART driver UC, and their corresponding GPIO pins are not assigned in the Pintool. If you enable RTS/CTS in the Driver UC, you must manually configure and assign the appropriate GPIO pins in the Pintool to ensure proper hardware flow control functionality.
