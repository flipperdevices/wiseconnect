## Purpose/Scope

- This application demonstrates the velocity, position count, index count, and direction measurement using the QEI module.

## Overview

- The QEI module provides the ability to measure the position and speed of a rotating encoder, which is essential for applications requiring precise motion control.
- It utilizes two input signals, Phase A and Phase B, to determine the direction of rotation, and an Index signal to mark specific positions.
- This example showcases how to configure the QEI module for real-time data acquisition, allowing for effective monitoring and control of motion systems.
- The QEI can process both incremental and absolute encoders, making it versatile for various applications in robotics, industrial automation, and consumer electronics.
- By leveraging the QEI’s high-resolution counting capabilities, users can achieve accurate position tracking and velocity measurement, enabling enhanced performance in dynamic environments.

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrates the use of the Quadrature Encoder Interface (QEI) to measure velocity, position, direction, and index counts from a quadrature encoder.
- Various parameters like phase A and phase B signals, index signal, and configuration settings can be managed using [`sl_qei_config_t`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/sl-qei-config-t).
- The example code emulates the behavior of a quadrature encoder by toggling GPIO pins for phase and index signals, simulating real-world encoder outputs.
- Dummy pulses are generated on gpio's and fed to the QEI pins using ulp timer.
- The firmware version of the QEI API is fetched using [`sl_si91x_qei_get_version`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/qei#sl-si91x-qei-get-version), which includes the release version, major version, and minor version, represented by  [`sl_qei_version_t`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/sl-qei-version-t).
- A static function initializes GPIO pins using [`sl_si91x_qei_stimulus_pin_mux_init`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/qei#sl-si91x-qei-stimulus-pin-mux-init), configuring the necessary pins for QEI operation.
- [`sl_si91x_qei_init`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/qei#sl-si91x-qei-init) is called to initialize the QEI peripheral.
- After initialization, [`sl_si91x_qei_set_configuration'] is called to set up the QEI parameters using a configuration structure [`sl_qei_config_t`].
- A callback function is registered using [`sl_si91x_qei_register_callback`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/qei#sl-si91x-qei-register-callback), allowing the application to respond to QEI interrupt events.
- The current position(range: 0 - 65535), index count(range: 0 - 65535), and direction are retrieved during processing through [`sl_si91x_qei_get_position_counter`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/qei#sl-si91x-qei-get-position-counter), [`sl_si91x_qei_get_index_counter`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/qei#sl-si91x-qei-get-index-counter), and  [`sl_si91x_qei_get_direction`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/qei#sl-si91x-qei-get-direction).
- If ENCODER_MODE macro is enabled, the application prints the current position, index, and direction of the encoder.
- If VELOCITY macro is enabled,the velocity is fetched using [`sl_si91x_qei_get_velocity`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/qei#sl-si91x-qei-get-velocity) and printed to the console when the velocity computation is completed.
- The application continuously runs in a loop, simulating the encoder’s output and processing the data to provide real-time feedback on the encoder's state.

> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
