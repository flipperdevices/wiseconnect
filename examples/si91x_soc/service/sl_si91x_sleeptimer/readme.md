## Application Build Environment

### Application Configuration Parameters

- On si91x devices, sleeptimer uses only the SYSRTC peripheral, and there is no UC for this component.

- Configure the following parameter in [`sleeptimer.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/service/sl_si91x_sleeptimer/sleeptimer.c) file, update/modify following macro if required

  ```C
    #define TOOGLE_DELAY_MS1_ONESHOT //  configured for 5000 ms
    #define TOOGLE_DELAY_MS1_PERIODIC // configured for 400 ms
  ```

## Test the Application

Refer instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. Sets the board state of LED to on and off after 5 sec and then configured for periodic blink rate of 400 ms.
3. LED should blink on WPK base board and prints should come on console.
