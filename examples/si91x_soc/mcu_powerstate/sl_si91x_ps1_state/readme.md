## Purpose/Scope

- This application demonstrates the PS1 state with RAM retention and NWP shutdown. 
  ```c
  Note: This application is designed to validate the MCU's power consumption values specified in the datasheet, and thus contain meticulous optimizations. This application should not be taken as reference for a real-time use case project bring up. This application does not support wake-up sources.
  ```

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrates the transition to the PS1 state, with RAM retention and NWP shutdown. By default, our application is configured to retain 320KB RAM.
- Initially, the Power Manager service is initialized, transitioning the processor to the PS3 state with the clock set to 40 MHz (Power Save) using sl_si91x_power_manager_init.
- The power domains will be disabled and NWP will be shutdown.
- The application will then switch to the PS2 state and clock is at 20 MHz. Then transition to PS1 state, stay at that state for 2 sec based on configuration of ULP timer and again change back to PS2 state.
- Finally, the application will enter the PS2 sleep mode.
  
## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

- To use this application following Hardware, Software and Project Setup is required.

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [[BRD4002](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wireless-pro-kit-mainboard?tab=overview) + [BRD4338A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-rb4338a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-radio-board?tab=overview) / [BRD4342A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx91x-rb4342a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-radio-board?tab=overview) / [BRD4343A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siw917y-rb4343a-wi-fi-6-bluetooth-le-8mb-flash-radio-board-for-module?tab=overview)]
  - The Serial Console setup instructions are provided below:

## Getting Started

Refer instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) for the following tasks:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

Refer instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) for the following tasks:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. By default, application turns off the NWP, enters the PS2 state, then switches to PS1, returns to PS2, and finally goes to PS2 sleep.
3. After successful program execution, the prints in the serial console look as shown below.
